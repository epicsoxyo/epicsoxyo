### Here's a bit about me:
My name is Megan, also known online as Soxyo - but you can call me whichever you feel more comfortable using!

You may know me as:
 - an Activision employee
 - a BSc Physics graduate from The University of Manchester
 - an MSc Games Programming student at Manchester Metropolitan University
 - a [2024 IG50 winner](https://www.intogames50.uk/ig50-2024)

While I may be relatively early in my games development journey, I'm very proud of how far I've come in such a short amount of time.
Since I began studying at Manchester Met last September, I've been eager to spend every hour I can on learning, practicing, and developing my programming knowledge.
I've taken part in multiple game jams, (even hosted my own!), worked across several teams of talented peers, and have pushed myself to become one of the top developers in my class.
And now, here I am, working as a programming intern for Activision! As you can probably imagine, I'm incredibly happy to be here :)

### Enjoy!

Feel free to take a look around - if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to send a message! I'd love to chat :)
